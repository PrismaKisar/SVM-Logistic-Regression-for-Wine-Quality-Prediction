# Wine Quality Prediction: SVM & Logistic Regression Implementation

## Project Overview

This project implements **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **Logistic Regression (LR)** algorithms from scratch to predict wine quality. The task is binary classification: predicting whether wines are "good" (quality â‰¥ 6) or "bad" (quality < 6) using both red and white wine datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
- **Files**: `winequality-red.csv` and `winequality-white.csv`
- **Features**: 11 physicochemical properties (fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, etc.)
- **Total samples**: ~6,500 wines (red + white combined)

## Requirements & Usage

### Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation & Execution
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run notebooks in sequential order:
   - `notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb` - Dataset analysis and visualization
   - `notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb` - Feature engineering and data preparation
   - `notebooks/models_evaluation.ipynb` - Model training and performance evaluation

### Implementation Structure
All core implementations are located in the `src/` directory:
- `models.py` - SVM and Logistic Regression algorithm implementations
- `model_selection.py` - Grid search and cross-validation utilities  
- `util.py` - Performance metrics and helper functions

## Key Results

### Performance Summary
- **Logistic Regression** consistently outperforms SVM across all configurations
- **Polynomial kernels** improve both models, with LR showing more controlled gains
- **Best accuracy**: 77.5% (Polynomial LR) vs 74.5% (Polynomial SVM)
