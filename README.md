# Wine Quality Prediction: SVM & Logistic Regression Implementation

## Project Overview

This project implements **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **Logistic Regression (LR)** algorithms from scratch to predict wine quality. The task is binary classification: predicting whether wines are "good" (quality â‰¥ 6) or "bad" (quality < 6) using both red and white wine datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
- **Files**: `winequality-red.csv` and `winequality-white.csv`
- **Features**: 11 physicochemical properties (fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, etc.)
- **Total samples**: ~6,500 wines (red + white combined)

## Academic Integrity

This project was completed in accordance with academic integrity policies. All implementations are original work, with appropriate citations for theoretical foundations and mathematical formulations.

## License
